            <h4>Sportclimbing, what?</h4>
            <p>Sport climbing is a form of rock climbing that relies on anchors fixed
              to the rock, in which a rope that is attached to the climber
              is clipped into the anchors to arrest a fall. A different discipline is bouldering,
              which involves climbing short distances
              with a crash pad as protection.
              This is in contrast to traditional climbing where climbers
              must place removable protection as they climb.

            <h4>Why would someone go up just for fun?</h4>
            <p>Sport climbing emphasises strength, endurance, gymnastic ability and technique.
            It goes hand in hand with facing the fear of heights (yes, every healthy person has it).
            Through climbing, people can learn to control their own minds and bodies. Breathe in, breathe out!</p>

            <h4>Some basic techniques</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Use your feet: people naturally have more strength in the legs than the arms   </li>
              <li>Straight arms are happy arms: this allows your skeleton to carry the bodyweight, not the muscles</li>
              <li>Keep the hips close to the wall: it helps to keep the weight on the feet</li>
              <li>Rest when there's a comfortable position: this allows the body to regain some energy</li>
              <li>And don't forget rule number 1: have fun!</li>
            </ul>
